# Machine-Learning-Multi-class-and-multi-label-classification-project
Created classifiers using support vector machines to realize anuran species recognition
Create an SVM for each of the labels and use cross validation to determine the penalty weight and kernel width;
To address class imbalance, tests with standardized data and the SMOTE approach were conducted; 
Built k-means clustering using Monte Carlo simulation to obtain a majority label triplet and determine the average  hammering distance, loss, and score.
